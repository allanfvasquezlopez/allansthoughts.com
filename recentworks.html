          <h2>untitled 1</h2>
          <h3>Neo-minimalist piano duet.<br>~4 minutes. 2018.</h3>
          <p><em>untitled 1</em> is the first composition I've created that has no formal title. Since I started composing back in 2014, I made it a point for each of my pieces to have a story, some kind of narrative and thus some explicit meaning to each piece. Following a very difficult break-up and a hard summer, I felt the need to write something kinda devoid of meaning and purely for expression. I also listen to a LOT of Steve Reich and Meredith Monk, so they've been big influences in my composition practice. This piece, I feel, marks a new "era" in my life, which I realized after I had finished it. It also marks the relinquishing of control over aspects of my art, as I've been doing more and more with my life. More recent pieces I've been working on have become more improvisatory and relinquish more and more aspects of the music for the performers to invent themselves. This piece, however, still retains a very traditional minimalist approach, evolving as a gradual process, reverting to the original idea, and then turning into something new that evolves and ends on a chord that's up for interpretation. Is it complete or incomplete? Hopeful or doubtful? There are probably other options.

      <h2>June 21st</h2>
      <h3>Post-minimalist piano duet.<br>~3 minutes. 2018.</h3>
      <p><b>THIS</b> piece is something that I wrote in just a couple of...hours? Maybe less? I forget, but it was created all in one day. Context: I visited the Museum of Contemporary Art in Downtown Los Angeles last summer (2018), and stumbled across this piece by Félix González-Torres called Untitled (March 5th) #2, which he made in 1991. WOW, talk about run-on sentences. Anyway, that piece <b>REALLY</b> hit me hard and I had to sit down for a long while to think about it before going on with my life. I just honestly had to <em>do</em> something with the information from this piece. Read below for the description I read on that day.</p>
      <p>"<em>Untitled (March 5th) #2</em> is one of many light strings made by González-Torres. Each comprises a cord or cords strung with light bulbs and can be installed, at the owner's discretion, on the floor or across a wall. However, this work is unique in that it must always be hung vertically on the wall, per the artist's instructions. Composed of two forty-watt bulbs placed at the end of each of two cords, it is González-Torres's first light string sculpture. It was made around the time of the death of his life partner, Ross Laycock, and the date indicated in the title, March 5th, is Laycock's birthday. Looped over a nail, the bulbs touch and glow together with the latent possibility that one may burn out before the other."</p>

      <h2>Vocal Patterns</h2>
      <h3>Pattern-loop neo-minimalist piece for 6-part vocal ensemble.<br>~7-8 minutes. 2018.</h3>
      <p>I've gotta say, this is one of my favorite pieces I've composed. It's a loop-based piece that is <em>meant</em> to be performed live without electronics by a six-part vocal ensemble. <b>However</b>, this composer isn't as strict about the performance choices of these pieces, so something like a solo vocalist with a loop pedal could be totally rad and is encouraged. This piece in particular is inspired by group singing of any kind, but intended to have an improvisational feel to it. Singers have cells which they repeat and continue to repeat until they get something new or have to fade out. The voices interlock at the beginning to create a melodic line, and then interlock again to create a pentatonic figure in the first transition. In the second section, each voice has their own rate of repetition (namely, different time signatures), which creates different patterns when all the voices are singing their cells simultaneously. After a short phasing of key (which is something I've possibly defined as a new concept, but simply means introducing a new key to an existing key and creating a bitonal moment to transition to the next key), the voices audbily get quieter but create another pentatonic figure and thus a transition to prepare for the last section. The C section, which I call the "In C" section, is a page that simply has various cells with different time signatures and the instructions for the performers is to sing through them and have fun with it. The piece ends on a glorious dominant chord, inspired by the overtone series.

      <h2>Cristian and the Magic Leaf</h2>
      <h3>Conceptual animated film trailer score piece for orchestra.<br>~2.5 minutes. 2018.</h3>
      <p>This piece was part of a small collaboration with my boyfriend at the time, who was studying animation. I had always wanted to see a little animated queer brown boy just having a regular ol' adventure on the big screen. So, I asked him (he, too, is a queer brown boy) if he would be willing to sketch someone like that. After some initial sketches and some development of what story we would tell through this character, I got to work. What came out of it was this piece, a demo of what could be the score for the trailer for this concept of an animated film. The illustration is by Lorenzo Crump (@crump.jpg) and the recording features Andrew McIntosh on viola.</p>

      <h2>Pitter-Patterns</h2>
      <h3>Neo-minimalist piece for string quartet,<br>piano, vibraphone, and marimba.<br>~5 minutes. 2018.</h3>
      <p>This is actually another one of my favorite pieces. It's funny how tight deadlines can sometimes get great things out of you... This piece is a kind-of-minimalist piece that focuses primarily on the percussion instruments. They begin a sort of canon at the unison (of one note, it's hardly even a canon) and build upon it to create a descending and ascending conglomerate melody and accompaniment. The strings act as embellishments to add some shine to the texture with some polyphony, and add an extra shimmer when they come in on homophonic chords. The end of the piece is sort of a reflection of the beginning, ending on the same piano note. However, the note ends up having a new context and thus might leave the listener with a new perception of the meaning of that single note.</p>
